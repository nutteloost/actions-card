**Actions Card** is a wrapper for any Home Assistant card that adds interactive gestures and actions. Transform any standard or custom card into an interactive element without modifying the original card. With Actions Card, you can navigate to different views, toggle entities, call services, open URLs, and more—all from cards that normally don't support these interactions.

## Features
- Add tap, hold, double-tap, and swipe actions to any card
- Swipe gestures in four directions (left, right, up, down) with touch and mouse support
- Multiple action types:
  - Toggle entities
  - Navigate to other views
  - Open URLs
  - Call services
  - Show more-info dialogs
  - Open the Assist dialog
  - Fire custom DOM events
- Confirmation dialogs for actions
- Configurable hold time
- Smart scrolling: automatically preserves normal scrolling on scrollable content
- Option to prevent default entity dialogs
- Visual editor support with card picker
- Works with both standard and custom cards

## Configuration
This card can be configured using the visual editor or YAML.

### Options
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `card` | object | Required | The card configuration to wrap |
| `tap_action` | object | `none` | Action to perform on tap |
| `hold_action` | object | `none` | Action to perform on hold |
| `double_tap_action` | object | `none` | Action to perform on double tap |
| `swipe_left_action` | object | `none` | Action to perform on swipe left |
| `swipe_right_action` | object | `none` | Action to perform on swipe right |
| `swipe_up_action` | object | `none` | Action to perform on swipe up |
| `swipe_down_action` | object | `none` | Action to perform on swipe down |
| `prevent_default_dialog` | boolean | `false` | Prevent the default entity dialog from opening |

### Prevent Default Dialog Option

The `prevent_default_dialog` option, when enabled, prevents Home Assistant from showing its standard entity information dialog when the wrapped card is interacted with. This is particularly useful when you've configured custom actions on the card and want to ensure they execute without the system's default dialog appearing. For example, if you've set up a tap action to navigate to another view, enabling this option will prevent the entity dialog from opening first, resulting in a smoother user experience.

### Action Options
Each action (tap_action, hold_action, double_tap_action) can use these configurations:

#### Toggle Action
Toggles the state of an entity (lights, switches, etc.).

```yaml
action: toggle
entity: light.living_room  # Optional - will use the entity from the wrapped card if not specified
``` 
*Options:*
- `entity` (optional): Entity to toggle. If not specified, uses the entity from the wrapped card.

#### Navigate action
Navigate to different Lovelace views or dashboards.

```yaml
action: navigate
navigation_path: /lovelace/0
navigation_replace: false  # Optional - replace or push state to history
```

*Options:*
- `navigation_path` (required): Path to navigate to (e.g., `/lovelace/0`, `/lovelace/lights`)
- `navigation_replace` (optional): Replace current history state instead of pushing new state

#### URL Action
Open external URLs or internal Home Assistant pages.

```yaml
action: url
url_path: https://www.home-assistant.io
target: _blank  # Optional - _blank or _self
```

*Options:*
- `url_path` (required): URL to open
- `target` (optional): `_blank` (new tab) or `_self` (same tab)


#### Call Service Action
Execute any Home Assistant service with custom data.

```yaml
action: call-service
service: light.turn_on
service_data:
  entity_id: light.living_room

```

*Options:*
- `service` (required): Service to call in format `domain.service`
- `service_data` (optional): Data to pass to the service

#### More Info Action
Show the entity information dialog.

```yaml
action: more-info
entity: light.living_room  # Optional - will use the entity from the wrapped card if not specified
```

*Options:*
- `entity` (optional): Entity to show info for. If not specified, uses the entity from the wrapped card.


#### Assist Action

```

*Options:*

### Confirmation Dialogs
You can add a confirmation dialog to any action:

```

confirmation:
  text: "Are you sure you want to proceed?"
  title: "Confirmation"  # Optional
  confirm_text: "Yes"    # Optional (default: Confirm)
  dismiss_text: "No"     # Optional (default: Cancel)
```

- `title` (optional): Dialog title
- `confirm_text` (optional): Text for confirm button (default: "Confirm")
- `dismiss_text` (optional): Text for cancel button (default: "Cancel")

#### Hold Time
Customize the hold time for hold actions (default is 500ms):

```yaml
hold_action:
  action: toggle
  entity: light.living_room
  hold_time: 700  # Time in milliseconds
  show_progress: true  # Show visual progress indicator
```

*Hold Action Options:*
- `hold_time`: Duration in milliseconds to hold before triggering (range: 100-2000ms, default: 500ms)
- `show_progress`: Show a circular progress ring during hold (default: false)
  - Displays a visual indicator showing how long to hold
  - Ring fills clockwise as time progresses
  - Fires action on release when ring completes
  - Automatically adjusts size for touch vs mouse input

## Swipe Gestures

Configure swipe actions in four directions: left, right, up, and down. Each swipe gesture can trigger any of the supported action types.

### Swipe Behavior

Swipe gestures work with both touch and mouse input, making them accessible on all devices. A swipe is detected when you quickly drag across the card—the gesture needs to cover at least 20 pixels and complete within one second. The direction is determined by the dominant axis of movement: if you swipe more horizontally than vertically, it registers as left or right; if you swipe more vertically, it registers as up or down.

The card intelligently preserves normal scrolling behavior on scrollable content. When you try to swipe vertically on a card with scrollable content (like a long list), the swipe action is automatically disabled in that direction, allowing you to scroll naturally. The same applies to horizontal swipes on horizontally scrollable content. This ensures your swipe actions never interfere with basic navigation.

### Example Configuration
```yaml
type: custom:actions-card
card:
  type: entities
  entities:
    - light.living_room
    - light.bedroom
swipe_left_action:
  action: navigate
  navigation_path: /lovelace/1
swipe_right_action:
  action: navigate
  navigation_path: /lovelace/0
swipe_up_action:
  action: call-service
  service: light.turn_on
  service_data:
    entity_id: all
swipe_down_action:
  action: call-service
  service: light.turn_off
  service_data:
    entity_id: all
  confirmation: "Turn off all lights?"
  ```
